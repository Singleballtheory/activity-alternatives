hello. Hi.

#### MVP: Users can find an activity to do based on some criteria/s or other.

#### Stretch Goals: 
- Users can input their own activities and have those available
- Users can filter activities by amount of available time, type, etc. [sort of part of the mvp]
- 

Person enters amount of time available & our app with give them suggestions of things to do that will fill that amount of time
-- I like the idea of it also being able to factor in things like: energy level, weather, how stressed out you are, activity level, budget

Imminent:
- Change document/repo name
- Basic HTML Framework
- Database of activities [objects with properties??]/structure for user to input activities/tasks they've been wanting to do
-  How do we save user data?
- What external services/resources do we need [& for what, specifically?]
- What categories do we need for activities?
- Reverse app: option to waste time instead of complete activities
- Inspirational and non-inspirational quotes
- How does a user remove/mark done an activity/task?
-- is there an API for to do list things? Is that even api stuff? >[
- 

Eventual:
- What is the name of our app?
- CSS styling
